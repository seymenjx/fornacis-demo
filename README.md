# Motivation
We believe that if you don’t have an active market you can not protect your value. Projects always need a buyer, a seller and a holder. But when we
analyze the current market conditions we can not see that projects fit these standards. If you analyze CryptoPunks you see them %0 listed because these
NFT’s benefits are at an extreme level therefore holders of the Punks don’t want to sell their PFP. But how do we achieve that? How can we make a
qualified project and why people want to sell it and why the other ones want to buy it? If everybody trades it, who and why do they hold it?

# Mechanism
Fornacis is mainly 3333 supply but we increase this amount in the process. So you think Fornacis is a 3333+3333 supply. Our main curiosity is what if
this thing causes an increase of the inflation rate. For this we divided this into 5 stages.
| Stages  |	Price	 (ETH) |			Supply |
|---------|:--------------:|------------------:|
| Stage 1 |		0.04	   |			400    |
| Stage 2 |		0.12	   | 			500    |  
| Stage 3 |		0.8		   | 		    800    |
| Stage 4 |		2		   | 		    650    |    
| Stage 5 |		10		   | 		    650    |

As you see the above when the price goes high that’s the only way to increase the supply at this time.
# Stage Conditions
  There are 3000 randomly generated numbers. When you buy an NFT from Opensea at random lucky number -only opensea- and if the price is equal or higher
of
the current stage’s, you get a golden ticket.
It is a little bit complicated. Let me give an example.
You bought an NFT from OpenSea for 1 eth price and o 48th person who buys the NFT under current stage is 3 and you are the lets say 48 is one of the
lucky numbers. You get a golden ticket.
On the other hand if you make everything the same but you are the 97th person, if 97 is not one of the lucky numbers you will get nothing.
# Golden Ticket 

 Golden Ticket is like a whitelist for the remaining (3333) supply. If you have a golden ticket you are eligible for the airdrop from remaining supply.
Everything is about the buying incentives so far. What about holding and selling incentives?


# Selling and Holding Incentives

  If you have more than 1 Fornacis in your wallet and if you sell one of them your other Fornacis’s get a streak point. Every two weeks the first 10
people on the streakboard will get a golden ticket too. 
For example, you have 10 Fornacis and you sell one of them. Your remaining Fornacis's streak point will be increased 1. You decided to sell one of them
too and your remaining NFTs is 8 but all your NFT’s have 2 streak points. Your streak point is 16. The optimum point is n/2 if n is an even number and
n+1/2 if n is an odd number. For 10 Fornacis if you want to make the most score your optimum point is 5. 


# Streakboard

  We will distribute 333 of Fornacis NFT to the top 11 of every week this means ant the remaining supply, after the 30 week 
As you understand it is so hard to draw a issuance schedule for Fornacis. We can only imagine when the stages are done but after the 6666 supply there
will be no NFT or Golden Ticket distribution.
